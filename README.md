## 🏗 Adding Pages

To create a new page:

1. Add a new component inside `src/pages/` (e.g., `Home.js`).
2. Import it and define a route in `App.js`:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/Home";

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## 🎭 Animations with Framer Motion

Easily add animations using Framer Motion:

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
    >
      <h1>Welcome to Creative Web Starter</h1>
    </motion.div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```
